## Overview
This application provides an end-to-end workflow for regression tasks, including:

- Uploading CSV datasets  
- Handling missing values, duplicates
- Visualize numeric feature boxplots
- Scaling numeric features (MinMax, Standard, Robust)  
- Encoding categorical variables (Label, One-Hot, Ordinal)  
- Splitting data into training and testing sets  
- Train KNN or linear-family regressors (Linear, Lasso, Ridge, SGD)  
- Displaying model performance (MAE, MSE)  
- Downloading the trained model as a `.pkl` file

## Features
- Data upload and exploration  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Outlier visualization  
- Feature scaling  
- Multiple regression model options  
- Model evaluation metrics  
- Model export functionality

## How It Works
1. Upload a CSV file containing your dataset.  
2. Choose preprocessing options (scaling, encoding, handling missing data).  
3. Select a regression model to train.  
4. View the performance metrics and evaluation results.  
5. Download the trained model for later use.
